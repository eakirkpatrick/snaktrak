Although we attempted to do some Mocha/Chai test cases, we were never able to successfully implement them.

Here are some manual tests that we ran through in order to test our program.

1 User
--
1. Register a new user with household id 1
2. Log in to users account
3. Add 6 bagels, costing 3 dollars each
4. Grab all 6 bagels, and make sure that the chart does not appear

2 Users
--
1. Register 2 users with household id 2
2. Log in to both accounts
3. Add 3 items as user 1 and 2 items as user 2
4. Verify that all of the items show up in each other's fridge
5. Grab the other persons items in each fridge
6. Verify that the balances in the chart are correct, and the color coordination for debt is also correct (green indicates that they owe money to you while 
red indicates that you owe money).

3 Users
--
1. Register 3 users with household id 3
2. Log into the accounts
3. Add some items to each account
4. Verify that by taking the items of the two other users, that your chart is updated accordingly and with the correct balance
5. Logging into the other two accounts, make sure that the color coordination on their charts is correct and that it shows that the first
user owes money to them.
6. On those same two accounts try grabbing some of the first users' food to show that the balance can be updated
7. Log back into the first user's account to make sure all of the quantities were updated correctly
8. Clear the balance

Other things to check for:
- Make sure that once the last item is grabbed, that item no longer appears in the fridge
- Make sure your password is correctly verified in registration
- You cannot see other users items if they have a different household id
- Clear the balance correctly
- Items that you added did not change the balance
